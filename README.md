# Vulnerability Scanner Web Application

## Overview
This Django-based web application provides tools for scanning web servers and networks for vulnerabilities. It includes features like server software checks, directory traversal, admin interface detection, and WordPress brute-force attack simulation & network scans for internal network reconnaissance.

## Installation

To set up the application:

1. Clone the repository:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:JelleFirlefyn/pentest-toolkit.git
```

2. Install & enable RabbitMQ
```
$ sudo apt install rabbitmq-server
$ sudo systemctl enable rabbitmq-server
$ sudo systemctl start rabbitmq-server
```

2. Install & enable Redis
```
$ sudo apt install redis
$ sudo systemctl start redis
$ sudo systemctl enable redis
```

3. Install dependencies:
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Navigate to the project directory:
```
$ cd vuln_scanner_web
```


5. Migrate the database:
```
$ python manage.py migrate
```

6. Run the Django development server:
```
$ python manage.py runserver
```

7. Start Celery worker (in a separate terminal):

```
$ celery -A vuln_scanner_web worker --loglevel=info
```

8. Use your browser to navigate to:
```
http://localhost:8000
```

## Usage

### Web Server Scans

1. **Server Software Check**:
    - Enter the URL of the web server to check for software version and end-of-life status.

2. **Directory Traversal**:
    - Provide the URL, select a wordlist, and set options for directory traversal scanning such as the file types & amount of threads.

3. **Admin Interface Detection**:
    - Enter the URL to detect exposed admin interfaces on the web server.

4. **WordPress Brute-force**:
    - Enter the URL of the WordPress site, a username, and select a password wordlist for brute-force testing.

5. **Certificate check**:
    - Enter the URL of the web server.

### Network Scans

1. **Host Discovery**:
    - Enter the IP address of the default gateway inside of your network including the short version of the subnet mask.

2. **Port Scanner**:
    - Enter the IP address of the target without subnet mask. Then choose between using scapy and nmap.

3. **Remote OS detection**:
    - Enter the IP address of the target without subnet mask. Then choose between using scapy and nmap (i recommended nmap).

4. **pcap Analysis**:
    - Upload your .pcap or .pcapng file.

### Settings

- **Wordlist Management**:
    - Upload, view, and delete wordlists used for various scans.

- **Proxy Management**:
    - Add, view, and delete proxies. Check and clean the proxy list.

## Recap

The journey began with a clear goal: to build a comprehensive vulnerability scanner web application using Django. This vision was ambitious, focusing on both web server and network scans. The application was envisioned to be a potent tool for ethical hacking enthusiasts, providing a suite of functionalities to assess and analyze various aspects of web and network security.

### Challenges and Solutions

Throughout the project, numerous challenges were encountered and overcome. Each feature implementation brought its own set of complexities, from setting up Django models and views to integrating Celery with RabbitMQ and Redis for asynchronous task handling.

One significant challenge was incorporating various scanning techniques like server software checks, directory traversal, admin interface detection, and WordPress brute-force attack simulation. Each required careful consideration of ethical implications and technical nuances.

Network scans introduced a different spectrum of functionalities, such as host discovery, port scanning, and remote OS detection, demanding a deep dive into networking concepts and tool integration like Nmap and Scapy.

Ofcourse I know that there will be bugs in this application. Due to shortage of time I have not yet tested this application very extensivly. This will be the first task when continueing to work on this project in the future.

### Learning Curve and Key Takeaways

This project was as much a learning journey as it was a development task. The intricacies of Django's framework were thoroughly explored, including form handling, file uploads, and dynamic template rendering.

The integration of Celery for background task processing was a valuable lesson in asynchronous computing, enhancing the application's efficiency and user experience. Moreover, the implementation of RabbitMQ and Redis introduced me to message broker concepts and the importance of reliable task queues in a complex application.

The journey also provided insights into the less technical, yet equally crucial, aspects of project management such as debugging, code optimization, and feature prioritization.

### Conclusion

In retrospect, the creation of this vulnerability scanner web application was a holistic experience, intertwining technical skill development with project management insights. It stands as a testament to the power of Python and Django in building robust, feature-rich applications, and a reminder of the continuous learning path in the ever-evolving landscape of web development and cybersecurity.
