# The class, "ICheck," is an abstract base class in Python. It is designed as an interface so that all checks can implement this interface.
# It includes an abstract constructor "init" that initializes the "target" attribute and a methods "scan"  and "report" that should be implemented in child classes.
# An example of how to implement this can be found in the dnssec check
